# Short Links

Quickly display a list of pre-saved texts and copy them to the current application.

## Usage

Create new short links by clicking the `+` button. You can then enter a name and a value for the short link. The name is used to identify the short link in the list, and the value is the text that will be copied to the clipboard when the short link is clicked.

- To paste a short link, select the correct one and press enter. The text will be pasted on the current application.
- To copy a short link to the clipboard, click on the short link in the list and select Copy. The text will be copied to the clipboard and a notification will be displayed to indicate that the text has been copied.
- To edit a short link, click on the short link in the list and select Edit. You can then change the name and value of the short link.
- To delete a short link, click on the short link in the list and select Delete. The short link will be removed from the list.

## Security

Short links are stored locally on your device and are not shared with any external services. The short links are stored in [Raycast's local storage](https://developers.raycast.com/api-reference/storage#localstorage.values) and are only accessible to the application itself.
